# React Hooks Re-intro

This repository is for React Hooks introduction.

It consists of several numbered branches.  
In each branch readme file goes over the code,  
explaining the advantages and caveats.

Here in the master branch is a plain [CRA](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) app.  
There are some additional configs for eslint using [eslint-config-fbjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-fbjs)  
with [eslint-plugin-react-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks).
And prettier config.

**Disclaimer**  

Most stuff in this repo and posts have already been discussed,  
by react team in the docs, by Dan Abramov in his amazing talk and blog,  
and other people.

This repo is just a summation of my knowledge about hooks I gathered so far.
Just putting stuff in my own words.
